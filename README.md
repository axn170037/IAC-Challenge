We analyzed the various insights about the state of the world’s children across different dimensions. We detail the methodology used to extract useful information from the various indicators under each dimension and rank countries based on the extracted score. We discuss the inhibitors for improving the Children’s growth and programs undertaken by successful countries which can be cross-pollinated.

The high degree of missing data adds another dimension to extract meaningful insight from the data.
